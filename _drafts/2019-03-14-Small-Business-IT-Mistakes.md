I've really worked the gamut of IT, from teeny tiny companies as their "IT Guy" all the way up to huge organizations where I'm just one of approximately twenty *thousand* people aligned with the same focus.  What's surprising to me is that organizationally, similar mistakes are made at all scales of technology services.

1) Expecting what's working today to be working tomorrow.

2) Living with manual processes that could easily be automated.

3) Taking a reactive approach to technology.
