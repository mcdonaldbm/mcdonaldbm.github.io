I'm going to level with you for a minute here.  There are a lot of Managed IT providers out there.  As someone entering the space, this is a little terrifying simply because I'm looking at a lot of competitors who can do things more cheaply or more profitably, or have more humans and money to throw at problems than I do.

Managing the cloud should be significantly different than running what you previously had on premise in someone elses data center.

Cloud providers let you manage your techonlogy at infintisimally small levels, meaning you should be paying *less* for the *same* service in the cloud than you were on premise.
