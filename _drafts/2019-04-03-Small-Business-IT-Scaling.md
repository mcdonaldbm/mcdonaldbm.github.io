If you're sitting in your office wondering why your technology is slow, disfunctional, or just plain sucks...  you're not alone.  Clients ask me often why their previous tech group was having so many issues, and the speculation is never easy.  Sometimes it's because of their outdated technology practices like creating manual processes, or an emphasis on in-person support.  Other times its because of the business and its unwillingness to move to newer technologies that would alleviate some of the problems they have.  My least favorite thing to see is when a small business thinks they have all of the solutions, and ask for solutions to be implemented rather than working together with the technology provider on the problems.  This is one of those times where that quote from Henry Ford comes into play where the punchline is "If I asked people what they wanted, I would've made a faster horse."  So many businesses keep building faster horses, especially when it comes to the cloud.

To that end, I've compiled a short list on some key tenants for scaling a small business IT department, or finding the right shop to provide those services.

## Remote Support Should Come First

This should be a given, but there is rarely a case for requiring support to be in-person.  There hardly ever is something you can do in-person that you can't do with a remote session or with administrative rights.  Using tools like Bomgar, TeamViewer, or even simply "Remote Desktop Protocol" built into Windows, there are a ton of ways to provide support without requiring physical presence.  Communication tools like Microsoft Teams and Slack have created environments to where getting ahold of tech support should be quick, seamless, and easy.

There are several reasons for your IT team to switch to being remote.  First, the ability to immediately solve the problem.  Second, you avoid being charged for travel, and it allows the company to provide more service to more customers.  Third, it allows for a bigger response during "real emergencies"

## Move Out of the Closet and Into the Cloud

One of the biggest risks I've seen as common practice in a small business is when servers are being run in a closet.

By utilizing the cloud, you're able to take advantage of increased reliability and guaranteed uptime.

## Automate Manual Processes

There was a point in time where I was performing a manual process, repeatedly, with the thought process that they wanted a human to make sure that no errors occurred during the manual input portion.  It didn't take me very long to realize that a human providing the input to this process created *many* more errors than having the process be handled by a computer from start to finish.

As soon as the process in question was automated, we immediately saw a boost to team productivity for the sole reason that we didn't have to spend a couple man hours per day performing this process.  Where we once felt swamped as a team, we quickly found more intelligent and creative ways to fill that time and further the goals of the business, as opposed to working through the grind.

## Build IT with the Business in Mind

## Conclusion

Small business IT should be easy to execute but we find many companies underperforming or failing entirely.  If you're ready to give it a switch you should look into alternate providers or find consultants to help get your team in gear.  One of the ways you can make this transition is to find companies willing to give free initial consultations.  NorthCode Solutions is a great place to get started learning to build and scale your IT in a way that brings it back to the business.
