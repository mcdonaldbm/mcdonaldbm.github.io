AWS has launched a new service (I say this, but they have launched about a hundred services in the last year so I don't know if this is still considered "new") which will allow you to create speech files from text.  I got excited when I heard this, because if you've heard me talk about community contributions, you'll know that I really don't like to talk all that much - my gift of gab is firmly rooted in keyboard communications.
