Well, here we have it.  Today, I've pushed a hard reset on my blog and now I'll be using jekyll on Windows and hosting it via github pages.  I'll let you know how I like it, but so far I'm much more impressed with it than I ever was with wordpress.  I'll be working on migrating my old blog posts into this jekyll/gh-pages format in the future.

Adam Bertram and a good chunk of the IT community have been working on blog posts similar to this, and the goal here is to show the world how those of us in IT do our jobs day to day.  Working remotely, this is actually a question I get a lot since I break the traditional 9-5 and have about a 15 foot commute.  Being from a college town, I also get asked this a ton by students who haven't entered the industry yet and are wondering what working in IT is really like once you get past all the homework.

I hope this gives you a good glimpse into the life!  If you have any questions feel free to shout out to me on Twitter.

**What is/are your current gig(s):**

My current gig is as a Solutions Engineer at PhishMe, Inc.  We specialize in information security solutions revolving around messaging and phishing in particular.  As a Solutions Engineer I'm directly involved in the development of our Reporter product as well as automate our packaging and delivery process of our software.

**What's one word to describe your work?:**

Automation

This is something that is getting more and more important.  Each week I try and take 40 hours of work and figure out how to do it in 30 or less the next week.  As time goes on this gets harder and harder, of course, but Powershell is robust enough to help us out here.
