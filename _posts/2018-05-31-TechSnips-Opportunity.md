I don't know if I'll ever be able to go to a training bootcamp again.  It's not because I haven't worked hard enough, and it's not because my company can't afford it.  I've simply reached a point in my career where I'm an expert on enough topics to where it's not viable for me to spend a week mostly relearning stuff I already know (but really have you seen the price tags on bootcamps recently?  No thanks).  The same goes for PluralSight!  Don't get me wrong, I love the service and I spend the majority of "headphone-in" time at work with a video in the background.  Whenever it comes to content related to my job, though, I've been finding myself skipping 3/4ths of the video to get to the content that matters to me.  I don't want to talk about youtube tutorials.  Unprofessional editing, volume that makes me want to gouge out my ears, and then there's those people who type the instructions in notepad while playing "Let the bodies hit the floor" at full blast...  you catch my drift.

The reason why [TechSnips](https://www.techsnips.io) got my attention was that it cuts out all the gimmicks and frills, and it provides a very raw, very direct, and very laser focused way to ingest information about various IT tasks.  I can search for content that, if I know _what_ to do, but I don't know _how_ to do it, will get me up and running in (usually) under 5 minutes.  [Adam Bertram](http://www.adamtheautomator.com) is the guy who is putting it all together, and he's recruited a team full of experts all over the field to create these snips.  You can find stuff on the nitty gritty details of PowerShell and SharePoint, all the way to managing web based services like IFTTT.  Some of my favorites so far have been the work by [Josh King](https://king.geek.nz/) about Trello, [Veronique Lengelle](https://veronicageek.com/) on SharePoint administration, and [Brandon Olin](https://devblackops.io/) on his [PoshBot PowerShell Module](https://github.com/poshbotio/PoshBot) which is like a chatops service.

As you can tell, it's not just an individual's effort making TechSnips happen, it's a whole field of engineers coming together to provide this.  Most of my contributions so far have been as a peer reviewer.  I've been ensuring technical accuracy (following along in most instances) and content quality.  I've also been making sure the audio and video being recorded is up to par to be viewed on any device.  Trust me when I say I'm very picky about this sort of stuff.  Only explained one way to solve a problem?  Try again.  Audio too quiet or to loud?  No fly, re-record necessary.  The content coming through the pipe at TechSnips is only the best, so you'll never have a question as to whether or not you'll have to try and find another video on the topic.

Soon, I'll be piping out content myself.  This will focus mainly around AWS tasks and version control through git and github.  A newborn and a downtown apartment are currently keeping me from getting the audio quality that I want, but here shortly I'll have the tools and time necessary to make my recordings to the standard that everyone at TechSnips strives for.

I strongly, strongly urge you to come to [TechSnips](https://www.techsnips.io) and give it a try.  It's free until June 5, 2018, so there's no harm in checking it out.  There are plans to have some free snips in the future, but if you want access to all the premium content it would be well worth your while.  Did I forget to mention it? Enterprise accounts are available.

I'll see you there.
