There are a lot of things that I've been spreading myself over recently.  TechSnips, auditioning for Pluralsight, and the one that has been taking the most of my time - the AWS PowerShell book.  I'm really excited to announce that yesterday I pressed the "Publish" button and released my first chapter!  You can download the intro and first chapter as a sample [on the leanpub site](https://www.leanpub.com/awspowershell).

One of the benefits of using Leanpub as a platform for publication is that I can modify, update, and reconfigure the book day by day.  This means that when AWS inevitably releases an update to the AWS PowerShell module, I'll be able to keep you up to date as well by updating the book.  This also means that if you have specific requests for how to do something in AWS, by all means let me know!  I'm writing this book for you, so you have a voice in determining what content gets put in there.

Thanks again for not only visiting my site, but also for checking out my book.  I'm doing as much as I can to contribute to a community that has defined my career, so please let me know what you think once you read the sample.
